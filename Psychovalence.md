*From the Greek **psychē** (mind, soul) and Latin **valeō** (to be strong, healthy)*

The ability of an individual to resist, endure, and recover from stress and emotional damage; mental or psychological strength.

## Components
Psychovalence is the confluence of two psychological traits: *resistance* (psychological hardiness), and *recovery* (psychological resilience). The two are related but independent aspects of personality. That is, an individual may maintain high resistance but low recovery, or vice-versa.
#### Resistance 
Psychovalent resistance is the capacity of an individual to resist damage to their mental health, often referred to as psychological hardiness.

Resistant individuals do experience distress and symptoms of trauma, however these persons tend to experience negative emotion, especially stress, less strongly and less frequently than individuals with low resistance. Those with high resistance are more likely to maintain their current habits, worldview, and self-esteem after a crisis, and tend to view stressful events with clarity and in appropriate context.

Resistance is, in essence, the ability to **remain stable** during and after a crisis.
#### Recovery
Psychovalent recovery is the ability of an individual to return to a positive mental state after significant stress, often referred to as psychological resilience.

Individuals with high recovery may experience severe distress and psychological damage, but are able to establish healthy habits, connections, and thought patterns afterwards with relative ease. These persons are better able to re-regulate their emotions and heal themselves once a crisis is over, though high recovery individuals with low resistance are liable to undergo significant psychological damage as a result of disproportionately mundane stressors.

Inversely, high resistance individuals with low recovery won't be significantly affected by any given traumatic event, but are susceptible to a slow, long-term decline as a result of many small unhealed traumas.

Recovery is the ability to **get better** after one's mind is damaged.

## As Application of OCEAN Traits
It's thought that there may be a correlation between psychovalence and the five-factor OCEAN personality model, though this is completely empirically unfounded.

Given the assumed sociability, creativity, and adaptability of psychovalent recovery, high recovery may correlate with high Openness, Extroversion, and Agreeableness in the five-factor model. Conversely, high resistance may correlate with low Neuroticism and high Conscientiousness. 

If applicable, this working model would 1. indicate that psychovalence is an enduring aspect of an individual's personality, 2. allow recovery and resistance to exist and be measured independently, and 3. allow psychovalence to be assessed using existing five-factor model assessments.
